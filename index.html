                    <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
                    <p>Born in the south of Sweden back in 1993, when the eyebrows were too thin, jeans too low waisted and tops too cropped - But also the decade that gave brith to the society we know and cherish today.</p>
                        <p>I got my first computer at the age of 6 and I remember my first computer game was Snoopy's Game Club. Let's just say it had some basic graphics and 8-bit music in all its' gloriousness. It helped me with a lot of things such as learning how to count Woodstocks and to find Charlie (the owner of Snoopy) who was hiding behind pumpkins... Oh wait! I know just what you're thinking! It's very valueable knowledge indeed.</p>
                        <p>But the most valueable lesson of it all, is that it taught me at a very young age that computers were (and still are, for that matter) the future.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>... AND HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE??</h3>
                        <p>In my early teens is when everything really kicked off. I started capturing photographs and manipulating them in Adobe's infamous Photoshop. I was getting more and more curious about other software such as programs that could record me playing on my electronic piano. </p>
                        <p>I used to hang out on MySpace and among all the emos (and all the other attention seeking people), I noticed that some of the pages were really different and simply cooler than the others. So since I was anything but cool I wanted to learn how to do just that (Whatever it was that they were doing to create that pink unicorn cloud when you hover over the "contact section").</p>
                        <p>I couldn't think of anyone else to ask other than my super hacker dad since he was the one to give me a fake Photoshop license key. He basically gave me a 5 minute tutorial on HTML and told me "Now, play around with it!". So I did and I slowly discovered so much more!</p>
                        <p>Now, more than 10 years later I feel like it is about time I make this more than a hobby. So please use this page as a reference. It has really brought back all the feels. FeelsGoodMan.</p>

                    <h3>3 "short" ones about me.</h3>
                        <h4>Interests</h4>
                            <p>I watch a lot of YouTube since internet culture is my lingo. But if I'm not absorbing all the latest memes I like to read about different things and probably the most random ones aswell, such as how to take apart a smart phone and put it back together... once again, valueable knowledge.</p>
                        <h4>Education</h4>
                            <p>I'm currently studying Programming at Komvux Helsingborg. Yay, computer nerding 24/7 is permitted.</p>
                        <h4>Work experiences</h4>
                            <p>I lived one year in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland and worked as an Au Pair. It was one of the best years of my life but still swiss chocolate doesn't beat swedish chocolate. Sorry not sorry.</p>
                            <p>I have worked in retail for 3 years, in 3 different stores. First, in a Samsung store where <I></I> learned that I prefer technology over people. Second, in a J.Lindeberg store where I learned that I never ever want to go skiing (I'm scared of heights). And third, in a Sir of Sweden store where I learned that suits will never be as comfortable as jeans and t-shirt.</p>
                        <h4>(Bonus) Most romantic thing anyone can say to you?</h4>
                            <p>"You are the CSS to my HTML" and "Code was successfully compiled"</p>
